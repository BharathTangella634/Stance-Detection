Successive generations of nativists have frothed about Irish, Italians, Polish, Chinese immigrants coming to steal American jobs. Yet America has became a superpower in those years. So is immigration really killing the job market? Or maybe we should look instead at what's different now?

How simple! And I felt good that the waitstaff (and behind-the-scenes cooks and busboys) were making a good wage. I've waited tables and I know the thrill of big tips, but as a diner I now vastly prefer the flat-rate, no-tip system. End tips, raise my prices and pay the waitstaff a great wage, please!",tip,AGAINST,1

The run-down building had a leaky roof and lost money, and was torn down a few years later at a total loss. My parents total income was $11,000 at the time, and they were expected to contribute $4,500 per year (they said no). Hence, I went to a state school. I think income is better!",wealth,NONE,1
"What a silly line of reasoning. We have to stop thinking about immigrants as people who simply take our stuff, as if there were a finite supply of ""jobs"" piled up in a warehouse somewhere, the distribution of which is a zero-sum exercise. Immigrants are people and people are assets; they bring their creativity, energy, and culture to America for everyone's benefit. If that needs to be stated in terms one can measure with a dollar value, think of immigrants as sources of customer demand, stimulating employment. Immigrant-run restaurants and shops are a perfect example. Would native-born Americans be working at Chinese restaurants or Mexican bakeries if not for immigration? No, because those businesses wouldn't exist in the first place, and we'd all be worse off as a result. If those who call for America to exclude immigrants get their wish, the immigrants will benefit some other country, at which point these same pundits will predictably get their pants in a twist because ""Country X is beating us"" in education, employment, creativity, etc.",immigrant,FAVOR,1

"When capital gains resulted in true investment, the argument that lowering it spurred economic grow for our nation made some sense. But capital gains in the 21st century arises much more from gambling. Trading equities in micro seconds, electronic trading that churns thousands of shares a second, looking only at todays, or even only at this minutes gain in the is not investment. Such activity isn't based on searching for companies that will do well in the long haul. Even management of pension funds and IRAs is done primarily for the fees charged by the investment managers who don't care it the funds go up or down, only if they get their piece. So actually capital gains tax rate should not be reduced or eliminated. It should be raised to the same rate charde on gasmbling monies sine it is now exactly the same.",capital gain,AGAINST,1
